The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value.
Hash function are irreversible.

x1 -> h(x1) -> y1
we cannot find x1 by feeding y1. Inverse not possible !!!
x2 -> h(x2) -> y2
x1-x2 = Δx
y1-y2 = Δy
There should be no way in which we can find a correlation between Δx & Δy.
