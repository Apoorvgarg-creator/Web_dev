md5 hash function -
The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value.
Hash function are irreversible.

x1 -> h(x1) -> y1
we cannot find x1 by feeding y1. Inverse not possible !!!
x2 -> h(x2) -> y2
x1-x2 = Δx
y1-y2 = Δy
There should be no way in which we can find a correlation between Δx & Δy.

md5 -> 32 bits
total possible md5 output -> 2^32 !!
so if we take x_1, x_2 , ... , x_(2^32 + 1) inputs 
for a x_i and x_j there will be y_i = y_j // hash collision

for small hash function ( < 2^128), there is a rainbow table
Rainbow table -
A rainbow table is a precomputed table for caching the output of cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering a key derivation function (or credit card numbers, etc.) up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a practical example of a space–time tradeoff, using less computer processing time and more storage than a brute-force attack which calculates a hash on every attempt, but more processing time and less storage than a simple key derivation function with one entry per hash. Use of a key derivation that employs a salt makes this attack infeasible.
