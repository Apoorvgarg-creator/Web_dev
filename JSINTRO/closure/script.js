// closure scope --> A closure is the combination of a function
// bundled together (enclosed) with references to its
// surrounding state (the lexical environment).
// In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer
//functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript,
// closures are created every time a function is created,
// at function creation time.
