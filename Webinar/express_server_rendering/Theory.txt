Earlier what we were doing was,
we had a frontend and backend,
frontend was rendering on the browser 
and whenever a client made a request
 an Api call was made and data was fetched


 Now , in server side rendering , when a request is made,
 server sends a html page as a response
 Api part not required

A template engine enables you to use 
static template files in your application. At runtime, the template 
engine replaces variables in a 
template file with actual values, and 
transforms the template into an 
HTML file sent to the client. 
This approach makes it easier to
 design an HTML page.
 Some popular template engines that work with Express 
 are Pug, hbs, Mustache, and EJS.
