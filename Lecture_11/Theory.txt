In Node.js , global, process and module exist but window(BOM) and DOM does not
whereas In browser, BOM and DOM exist but global,process and module does not

if( typeof window !== 'undefined'){
console.log('running in browser')
}else{
console.log('running in node')
}


Both node and browser (latest version) have "globalThis" .. The most outer scope and used by both browser and node
In node                                 In Browser
globalThis == global                    globalThis == window
